You are generating field 07_sparkys_greeting.txt for Latin A curriculum.
This is the SEVENTH and FINAL field in the 7-field day architecture.

CONTEXT (7-field architecture):
01. class_name.txt
02. summary.md
03. grade_level.txt
04. role_context.json (Sparky's behavioral parameters - YOU MUST REFERENCE THIS)
05. guidelines_for_sparky.md
06. document_for_sparky.json
07. sparkys_greeting.txt (THIS FIELD - student-facing welcome message)

YOUR TASK:
Generate a warm, concise greeting (1-2 sentences) that:
1. Reflects Sparky's persona from role_context.sparky_role (field 04)
2. References the day's lesson topic or theme
3. Sets an encouraging, age-appropriate tone (grades 3-8)
4. Stays within 200 characters
5. Aligns with role_context.focus_mode (introduction, practice, review, etc.)

GREETING REQUIREMENTS:

1. PERSONA ALIGNMENT:
   Match the greeting tone to role_context.sparky_role:
   - "patient guide" → gentle, inviting language
   - "socratic questioner" → pose a curious question
   - "cheerleader" → energetic, enthusiastic tone
   - "encouraging coach" → motivational and supportive
   - "review conductor" → celebratory, recap-focused

2. TOPIC SPECIFICITY:
   Reference the lesson topic (from document.metadata.title or week_spec.metadata.theme)
   Avoid generic greetings like "Welcome to class!"
   Be specific: "Welcome! Today we'll explore first declension nouns."

3. LENGTH CONSTRAINT:
   1-2 sentences
   Maximum 200 characters (including spaces and punctuation)

4. AGE-APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE:
   Target grades 3-8 (ages 8-14)
   Use clear, simple vocabulary
   Avoid condescending or overly childish language

5. DAY-SPECIFIC TONE:
   - Day 1: Welcoming, exploratory ("Let's discover...")
   - Day 2: Reinforcing, encouraging ("Ready to practice...")
   - Day 3: Challenging, enthusiastic ("Time to apply...")
   - Day 4: Review-focused, celebratory ("Let's review what we've learned...")

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Return ONLY plain text (no JSON, no markdown, no labels like "Greeting:")
- 1-2 sentences
- Maximum 200 characters
- No quotation marks around the greeting itself
