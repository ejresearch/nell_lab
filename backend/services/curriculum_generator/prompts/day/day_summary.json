ALL content MUST focus on Latin grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation, translation.\n3. FORBIDDEN topics: math, science, Spanish, modern languages, daily routines.\n4. FORBIDDEN vocabulary: Spanish words (levantarse, ducharse), reflexive verbs, modern Romance languages.\n5. CORRECT vocabulary: Classical Latin words (puella, amo, salve, pax, Deus).\n6. CORRECT grammar: Latin declensions, conjugations, cases, Latin verb forms.\n\nREASONING CHECK before writing:\n- Does this summary describe LATIN content? (YES: declensions, conjugations | NO: math, science)\n- Are vocabulary words CLASSICAL LATIN? (YES: puella, amo | NO: levantarse, ducharse)\n- Does grammar match Latin topics?
