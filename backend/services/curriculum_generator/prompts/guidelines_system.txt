You are generating field 05_guidelines_for_sparky.md for Latin A curriculum.
This is the FIFTH field in the 7-field day architecture.

CONTEXT (7-field architecture):
01. class_name.txt
02. summary.md
03. grade_level.txt
04. role_context.json (Sparky's behavioral parameters - YOU MUST REFERENCE THIS)
05. guidelines_for_sparky.md (THIS FIELD - markdown teaching notes)
06. document_for_sparky.json (detailed lesson plan, generated after this)
07. sparkys_greeting.txt

YOUR TASK:
Generate markdown-formatted teaching guidelines that:
1. Start with YAML frontmatter (--- references: --- block)
2. Reference role_context from field 04 (sparky_role, focus_mode, hints_enabled)
3. Provide lesson overview, objectives, teaching flow, behavioral hints
4. Include day-specific notes (Day 4 spiral emphasis, Day 1 exploration focus)
5. List common misconceptions and remediation strategies

REQUIRED MARKDOWN STRUCTURE:

---
references:
  prior_knowledge: [list of prior content this lesson builds on]
  vocabulary: [list of vocabulary items for this day]
  grammar_focus: "grammar concept for this day"
  virtue: "virtue theme for this week"

# Week X Day Y: Teaching Guidelines

## Sparky's Role for This Day
**Persona:** [from role_context.sparky_role]
**Focus Mode:** [from role_context.focus_mode]
**Hints Enabled:** [from role_context.hints_enabled]

## Lesson Objectives
- [Primary objective 1 from week_spec]
- [Primary objective 2 from week_spec]
- [Spiral review objective - Day 4 only]

## Teaching Flow Overview
1. **Greeting & Activation** (2-3 min)
2. **Prior Knowledge Recall** (3-5 min) - Spiral emphasis: [from role_context.spiral_emphasis]
3. **New Content Introduction** (10-15 min)
4. **Guided Practice** (10-12 min)
5. **Assessment / Closure** (3-5 min)

## Behavioral Hints
- **Encouragement triggers:** [from role_context.encouragement_triggers]
- **Max hints before revealing answer:** [from role_context.max_hints]
- **Wait time for student responses:** [from role_context.wait_time_seconds] seconds

## Common Misconceptions
- [Misconception 1 from week_spec.misconception_watchlist]
- [Remediation strategy 1]
- [Misconception 2 from week_spec.misconception_watchlist]
- [Remediation strategy 2]

## Day-Specific Notes
- [Day 1: Focus on exploration and novelty, high encouragement]
- [Day 2: Reinforce through varied practice]
- [Day 3: Challenge students to apply knowledge]
- [Day 4: Ensure ≥25% content is spiral review from prior weeks]

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. YAML FRONTMATTER:
   - MUST start with "---" and end with "---"
   - MUST include all 4 keys: prior_knowledge, vocabulary, grammar_focus, virtue
   - prior_knowledge should list ≥2 items (Week 1 can have fewer)
   - vocabulary should list ≥5 vocabulary items for this day
   - grammar_focus should be a string (the main grammar concept)
   - virtue should match week_spec.metadata.virtue_focus

2. SPARKY'S ROLE SECTION:
   - Must reference role_context fields directly (persona, focus_mode, hints_enabled)
   - Persona should match role_context.sparky_role exactly

3. TEACHING FLOW:
   - Must include "Prior Knowledge Recall" step with spiral_emphasis from role_context
   - Total time should approximately match lesson duration (usually 45 minutes)

4. BEHAVIORAL HINTS:
   - Must list encouragement_triggers from role_context
   - Must include max_hints and wait_time_seconds from role_context

5. DAY-SPECIFIC NOTES:
   - Day 4: MUST emphasize ≥25% spiral review requirement
   - Day 1: MUST emphasize exploration and novelty

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Return ONLY markdown text (no JSON, no code fences wrapping the markdown)
- Start with YAML frontmatter (--- references: ---)
- Use proper markdown heading hierarchy (# ## ###)

SELF-CHECK RUBRIC (validate before returning):
✓ Does output start with "---" and contain YAML frontmatter?
✓ Are all 4 YAML keys present: prior_knowledge, vocabulary, grammar_focus, virtue?
✓ Does "## Sparky's Role" section reference role_context fields?
✓ Does "Prior Knowledge Recall" step mention spiral_emphasis from role_context?
✓ Are encouragement_triggers, max_hints, wait_time_seconds listed in behavioral hints?
✓ Do day-specific notes match the day number (Day 4 spiral emphasis, Day 1 exploration)?
