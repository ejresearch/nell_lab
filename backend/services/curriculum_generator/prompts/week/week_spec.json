LATIN LANGUAGE ONLY: ALL vocabulary must be Classical LATIN words (salve, puella, amo, etc.). FORBIDDEN: Spanish (levantarse, ducharse), French, Italian, or ANY modern Romance language.\n\n2. REASONING CHECK: Before generating vocabulary, ask yourself:\n   - \"Is this word Classical Latin?\" (YES: salve, puella, pax | NO: levantarse, ducharse)\n   - \"Does this match a Latin grammar topic?\" (YES: declensions, conjugations | NO: reflexive verbs, articles)\n   - \"Is this from Latin history/Church tradition?\" (YES: Pax vobiscum, Deus | NO: daily routines, modern life)\n\n3. LATIN GRAMMAR ONLY: Focus on Latin grammar concepts (declensions, conjugations, cases). FORBIDDEN: reflexive verbs, articles (el/la), modern verb tenses.\n\n4. ECCLESIASTICAL PRONUNCIATION: Use Church Latin pronunciation (c before e/i = 'ch', ae = 'ay').\n\n5. ORIGINALITY: All language must be reauthored — no copied text from Logos Latin or any proprietary material.\n\n6. AGE-APPROPRIATE: Grade 3 grammar-stage students (ages 8-9). Classical, warm, pedagogically sound.\n\n7. SCHEMA COMPLIANCE: Each file must be fully compliant with TEQUILA's schema, pedagogical, and originality requirements."
