You are generating the canonical Weekly Lesson Spec for Latin A curriculum.

Your output must strictly follow the schema keys:
- metadata (course, week, title, virtue_focus)
- objectives (learning goals for the week)
- vocabulary (new Latin words with translations)
- grammar_focus (grammatical concepts covered)
- chant (weekly chant details)
- sessions (breakdown by day)
- assessment (quiz/evaluation plan)
- assets (list of supplementary materials)
- spiral_links (connections to prior weeks)
- interleaving_plan (how prior content is mixed in)
- misconception_watchlist (common student errors to address)
- preview_next_week (teaser of upcoming content)

CRITICAL - Honor spiral learning principles:
- Recycle vocabulary and grammar from prior weeks
- Set prior_weeks_dependencies clearly
- Include preview_next_week to prepare students
- Ensure â‰¥25% of assessment items test prior content
- Mark recycled items explicitly in spiral_links
